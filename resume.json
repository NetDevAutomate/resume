Customer engagements also mean working closely with customer account teams and network service teams.\n\nCloud Networking as Code: I lead a Cloud Networking as Code (CNaC) group driving AWS Networking as Code practices. Working closely with AWS Networking Service Teams the CNaC team contribute to IaC Frameworks to ensure support for AWS Networking services which include contributing to the AWS Terraform Provider and developing AWS CDK L2 Constructs. With robust framework support, sample code representative of enterprise use cases are written and published, where needed, the team also write and publish AWS Terraform Modules and CDK \nConstructs for general consumption.\n\nI am a member of Networking, Builder Experience and Open-Source Software TFCs (Technical Field Communities) serving as a bridge between the 3 TFCs to further drive Networking as Code.\n\nWorkshops: I have orchestrated and delivered internal, instructor led, hands-on multi-day workshops to teach – Contributing to the AWS Terraform Provider, Using the AWS CDK to deploy AWS Networking architecture and How to write Terraform Modules. These workshops have enabled over 500 Solution Architects and Professional Services consultants globally.\n\nSDE Activities: In order to raise the bar on published code artefacts I wanted to get involved in production SDE work as I had been a self-taught programmer. I have established an SDE Apprenticeship Program providing a structured apprenticeship working with a SDE team as a part-time SDE on production code. As the pilot apprentice I am working with the AWS Network Manger/Cloud WAN service team as a part-time SDE which involves working on production Cloud WAN code.",

The architecture will provide connectivity between BP and BPs cloud infrastructure, host an SDWAN head-end and provide a highly converged hosting environment for network virtual functions and management infrastructure.

I’ve written Ansible modules in Python for discrete firewall and Cisco ISE functions as well as several Ansible playbooks for configuration audit, standardisation and change across a large heterogeneous network. I've also used Terraform to provision infrastructure across Azure and on-premise VMware clusters for the SDWAN head-end architecture deployment. Where neither Ansible nor Terraform are viable Python is used to deliver the function, often using Nornir.\n\nTo further educate the wider team, I’ve organised a serious of workshops with automation subject matter experts from several vendors both from a network-specific and broader automation perspective.

The full solution underwent rigorous testing through SVS (Cisco Validated Solutions) prior to deployment during which I spent two weeks in RTP working with Cisco AS and the SVS teams.\n\nFour autonomous CNX environments were deployed, two in the US and two in EMEA using carrier neutral facilities (Equinix). Each CNX used Cisco ACI to provide a flexible, high throughput fabric. The CNX design consists of an ACI fabric with Cisco Firepower Threat Defense devices for security policy enforcement and NIPS functions, AVI for load balancing, GSLB and WAF functions as well as SSL inspection. Cisco CSP-2100 (Cloud Service Platforms) are used to provide an NFV platform. \n\nThe CNX2.0 design contributed heavily to Cisco’s SAE (Secure Agile Exchange) solution.\n\nEach CNX will provides connectivity to BPs strategic cloud providers, migrated network services  such as Internet and Extranet Gateways, MAN circuits, telecom and voice services etc. \n\nDuring the CNX2.0 build, where possible I used Ansible and Python to deploy and change network configuration, deploy and manage load balancing infrastructure, maintain Linux bastion server builds, collect network configurations and store in a local GIT repository.",
